# Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my online internship program with **Elevate Labs**.  
The objective was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful insights from the data.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **File Used:** train.csv
- **Description:** Passenger details including demographics, travel class, fare, and survival status.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading** – Imported the Titanic dataset into Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values and corrected data types.
3. **Univariate Analysis** – Studied distributions of Age, Fare, and categorical columns.
4. **Bivariate Analysis** – Compared features like Sex, Pclass, and Fare with survival rate.
5. **Multivariate Analysis** – Used correlation heatmaps and pair plots to find relationships.
6. **Insights & Observations** – Summarized findings based on visualizations.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- Passengers in 1st class had better survival chances.
- Most passengers were between 20–40 years old.
- Higher fares were associated with higher survival probability.
